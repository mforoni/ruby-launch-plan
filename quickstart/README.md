# Ruby Quickstart

## About Ruby

[Ruby][] is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

### The Ideals of Ruby’s Creator

Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

[About Ruby][] provides an interesting overview of the main aspects of the language:

* Seeing Everything as an Object
* Ruby’s Flexibility
* Blocks: a Truly Expressive Feature
* Ruby and the Mixin
* Ruby’s Visual Appearance

### Features

Pass by value for immediate values
:    Immediate values are not passed by reference but are passed by value: `nil`, `true`, `false`, `Fixnums`, `Symbols`, and some `Floats`.

## Steps

My quickstart launch plan to master Ruby is to complete the following tutorials/articles/blogs:

* [x] [Ruby in Twenty Minutes - www.ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
* [ ] [Ruby Tutorial - rubylearning.com](http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html)
* [x] [Ruby: pass by value or pass by reference?](http://rubyblog.pro/2017/09/pass-by-value-or-pass-by-reference)
* [ ] Ruby collections

## Bonus

### Most Precious Gems

[RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop) is a Ruby static code analyzer and code formatter. Out of the box it will enforce many of the guidelines outlined in the community [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/).
