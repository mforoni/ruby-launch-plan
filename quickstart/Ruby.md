# Ruby

## Features

Pass by value for immediate values
:    Immediate values are not passed by reference but are passed by value: `nil`, `true`, `false`, `Fixnums`, `Symbols`, and some `Floats`.

Ruby methods **always** return the evaluated result of the last line of the expression unless an explicit return comes before it.
