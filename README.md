# Ruby Launch Plan

My Launch Plan to learn the Ruby programming language.

## Steps

1. [quickstart](quickstart/README.md): learn about the philosophy, syntax and major aspect of the language itself.
2. [style](style/README.md): learn about the most important conventions and style rules.
3. [rbenv](rbenv/README.md): manage your ruby environment properly, avoid permission issues while installing dependencies
4. [gems-demo](gems-demo/README.md): simple `hello_world.rb` that uses a dependency - a *Gem*. Learn about *bundler* i.e. how to keep your dependencies in an isolated environment and bundle them together with your own library.
