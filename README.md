# Ruby Launch Plan :rocket:

A Launch Plan to learn the Ruby programming language.

## About Ruby

Ruby is an **interpreted**, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

Ruby is **dynamically typed** and **garbage-collected**. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.[^1]

## Steps

1. [quickstart](quickstart/): learn about the philosophy, syntax and major aspect of the language itself.
2. [style](style/): learn about the most important conventions and style rules.
3. [rbenv](rbenv/): manage your ruby environment properly, avoid permission issues while installing dependencies
4. [gems-demo](gems-demo/): simple `hello_world.rb` that uses a dependency - a *Gem*. Learn about *bundler* i.e. how to keep your dependencies in an isolated environment and bundle them together with your own library.
5. [rspec-demo](rspec-demo/): learn how to write unit tests.
6. [projects](projects/): start creating some typical simple ruby projects. Follows the [learn by doing principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing).

## Books

1. *Well Grounded Rubyist by David A. Black*. The Well Grounded Rubyist is an extensive book. It combines deep knowledge with interactive exploration. At the end of the book you will have studied the ins and outs of Ruby but won’t have completed a larger project. It is approachable enough for a beginner but meaty enough for intermediate programmers. If you’re looking to truly understand how and why Ruby works, this is the book for you.

2. *Programming Ruby 1.9: The Pragmatic Programmers’ Guide (Facets of Ruby)* - has long been considered the Ruby Bible. Along with great tutorials and explanations, Programming Ruby contains a thorough reference of the Ruby language. It’s approachable enough for near beginners and exhaustive enough to serve intermediate and advance programs as a reference for a long time

3. *Eloquent Ruby (Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series)* “This is a book about making that final leap, about absorbing the Ruby programming culture, about becoming truly fluent in Ruby.” —Russ Olson. If you’re ready to truly embrace writing code “the Ruby way”, this is the book for you.
