# Todo List CLI

A simple CLI to manage a TODO list backed by a CSV file.

Developed trying to follow MVC pattern, Agile methodologies and TDD. A great detailed guide can be found at [github.com/mindplace/ruby-todo-list](https://github.com/mindplace/ruby-todo-list).

## Release 0

Given a CSV file with a list of todo items our first release should simply print the list.
